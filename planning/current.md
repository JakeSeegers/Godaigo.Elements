## Active Branch
`claude/bot-refinement-next-steps-yiwl0c` → remote: `JakeSeegers/Godaigo.Elements`
(previous: `claude/win-screen-trigger-bug-3iv5dx`; base: `4.10.progresscheck`)

## Last Committed Work
- **BOT STAGE 2 (forward model + lookahead)** — `js/bot-sim.js` (new):
  pure `simulate(snap, action)` over the Stage-0 snapshot (move incl.
  tile-reveal-as-unknown, endTurn incl. shrine collection + COLOR_RANK turn
  order, placeStone incl. fire-destruction rules, cast with whitelist-gated
  effects), pure `legalActions(snap)`, `isTerminal/winner`, and a
  `validate()` mirror-and-diff harness. Validated headless (Playwright +
  tutorial board): 0% divergence for move/endTurn/placeStone/discard
  (~750 mirrored actions) — roadmap target was <1%. Lookahead in `bot.js`:
  `searchPick()` beam search + `evaluateSnapshot()`, enabled by
  `WEIGHTS.searchDepth > 0` (**default 0 = greedy unchanged**; flip only on
  Stage-3a arena evidence). Also fixed `BotState.applyAction('cast')`
  silently no-opping when castSpell's multi-match selection popup appears.
  Full details + new gotchas: docs/bot-roadmap.md § STAGE 2.

## Previously Committed Work
- **NEW WIN CONDITION (rules change):** winning now requires activating all 5 elements
  AND returning the pawn to the centre of your own player tile (the "player shrine").
  Single gate: `checkWinCondition(playerIndex, {announce})` in `game-core.js` (also on
  `window`). All former `activated.size === 5` checks route through it; movement paths
  (placePlayer move branch, broadcastPlayerMovement, movePlayerVisually) call it on
  arrival. Includes: shrine beacon (pulsing ring on the player tile), "return to your
  shrine" status prompt, bot support (`WEIGHTS.moveReturnHome`, snapshot tiles carry
  `playerIndex`), tutorial + docs text updates.
  This also fixes the original bug where a `requiresSelection` scroll (e.g. Control the
  Current) as the 5th element never triggered the win screen — the win check now runs
  before the early return in `applyScrollEffects()`.
- Joytone adaptive music integration: `joytone/` (embedded music app + MIDI/sf2 assets),
  `js/joytone-bridge.js` (hidden iframe, Shift+J+T popup, tile-reveal → seeded riff,
  per-player mute/volume in Settings). Details: js/INDEX.md § joytone-bridge.js.
- Tutorial system: player places own tile, explores freely, first flip forced to Earth
- Distributed docs system: CLAUDE.md, js/INDEX.md, js/scrolls/INDEX.md, css/INDEX.md,
  docs/INDEX.md, planning/current.md, .claude/skills/sync-docs.md

## Current Status
Tutorial functional through step 4 (Earth tile reveal + scroll drawn). Steps 5–14
exist in code but are untested end-to-end. Docs system fully in place.

## NEXT SESSION TASK LIST (priority order)

### 0. Bot track (see docs/bot-roadmap.md)
1. ~~Stage 3a — self-play arena~~ **DONE** (`js/bot-arena.js`). First
   measurements: HYBRID search beat greedy **12-3-5** over 20 games →
   hybrid is now the default bot brain (searchDepth 3 + searchHybrid 1).
   Full always-on search LOST 1-3-4 — don't enable without new evidence.
   Arena runs also flushed out + fixed 5 real bot bugs (stale hex-grid
   cache, cul-de-sac freezes, hand-only planning, missing common-area
   casts/voluntary discards, anti-freeze vs shrine collection) — details
   in bot-roadmap § STAGE 3a.
2. **NEXT: Stage 2.5 — scroll-effect usage** (`js/bot-effects.js`): drive
   selection-mode effects instead of cancelling them, play response
   scrolls, whitelist driven effects in BotSim. Each increment
   A/B-measured in the arena. Full plan: bot-roadmap § STAGE 2.5.
3. Later: rerun hybrid-vs-greedy at 100 games + run BotArena.evolve()
   at scale (wants R5 server-side execution to be practical).

### 1. Tutorial — Earth Shrine Step (MEDIUM, tutorial-mode.js)
After step 4 (scroll found), the tutorial should:
- Guide player to walk to the **center hex of the earth tile** (the shrine center)
- Tell them to **End Turn** there to collect 5 earth stones
- The `#end-turn` button spotlight already exists in step 8 (`getting-stones`) — but
  the flow needs an explicit "now go stand on the shrine center and end your turn" step
  BEFORE the stone-abilities explanation.
- Hook to use: `onPlayerMoved(x,y)` is currently a no-op — wire it up to detect when
  the pawn is within ~20px of `EARTH_POS` (the revealed earth tile center) and set a
  flag. Then detect end-turn from `onEndTurn` hook (doesn't exist yet — needs adding
  in `game-core.js` where `endTurn()` is called).
- Alternatively: advance automatically when `stoneCounts.earth` increases (check after
  end-turn resolves).

### 2. Source Pool Win Condition Bug (HIGH, game-core.js)
**Rule (from game design doc):** If the source pool for an element has 0 stones remaining,
casting a scroll of that element still works (effect fires) but does NOT count toward
the player's win condition. The win condition only registers if ≥1 stone of that type
exists in the source pool at cast time.

**Where to fix:** `applyScrollEffects()` in `game-core.js`, specifically the block that
calls `spellSystem.activated.add(element)` (the win-condition tracking). Before that
add call, check `stoneCounts[element] > 0` (stoneCounts = source pool). If 0, skip
the add but still run the scroll effect. Show a status message like:
"Scroll cast! (No [element] stones in the source pool — win condition not awarded.)"

**Relevant variables:**
- `stoneCounts` = source pool (global, 0–25 per element)
- `spellSystem.activated` = Set of elements the active player has won
- The `cancelled` flag already exists for a different case (empty hand on Sacrificial
  Pyre) — do NOT reuse it here; add a separate `noWinCondition` flag or inline check.

### 3. Tutorial — Clarify Stone/Scroll Limits
The tutorial text is vague. Make these explicit at the appropriate steps:
- **Player stone pool**: max **5** of each element type (shown as `X/5` in left panel)
- **Source pool**: max **25** of each element type (shared across all players)
- **Hand size**: max **2** scrolls
- **Active area**: max **2** scrolls
- **Source pool + win condition**: if source pool for an element hits 0, casting a
  scroll of that element won't count toward your win — acknowledge this in the
  "getting stones" step of the tutorial.

## Known Open Issues
- `TRANS-WIN-CON`: Transmute (Fire IV) doesn't always stamp fire symbol on player tile
- `TRANS-DOUBLE-DISP`: Transmute inventory display stale after discard
- `onPlayerMoved` hook in game-ui.js exists but tutorial-mode.js treats it as no-op
- Steps 5–14 of tutorial untested in full sequence

## Files Currently In Flight
None — all changes committed and pushed.

## How To Resume
1. `git log --oneline -5` to confirm last commits
2. `npx serve -p 3333` → open `http://localhost:3333`
3. Click "Play Tutorial" on auth screen (do not log in)
4. Play through to step 4 to confirm baseline, then work on task list above
